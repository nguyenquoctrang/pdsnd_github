### Project Title
Bike Share Data Analysis

### Description
This project explores data from bike share systems in three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Using Python, we import the data and compute descriptive statistics to answer interesting questions related to bike usage. Additionally, an interactive script is created to allow users to explore the data through the terminal by inputting raw data, offering a hands-on experience with the dataset.

### Files used
