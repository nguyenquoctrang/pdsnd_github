### Project Title
Exploring U.S. Bike Share Data

### Description
This project provides an in-depth analysis of bike-sharing data from three major U.S. cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Using Python and libraries like NumPy and pandas, this project explores trends and patterns in bike usage, providing insights such as:

- The most common travel times and days of the week.
- Popular start and end stations.
- Travel times for each trip.
- Usage patterns across user demographics.

To make the analysis more interactive, a command-line interface allows users to choose the city and apply filters by month or day to explore targeted insights. This interactivity offers a dynamic way to explore the data based on user input.

### Files used
The analysis is based on the following datasets:
- **chicago.csv**: Bike-sharing data for Chicago
- **new_york_city.csv**: Bike-sharing data for New York City
- **washington.csv**: Bike-sharing data for Washington, D.C.

Each file contains columns on start and end times, trip durations, start and end stations, and user data like gender and birth year (except for Washington, which lacks gender and birth year data).

### Credits
This project was developed as part of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree program. Additionally, guidance on project structure and data exploration was inspired by Udacityâ€™s materials and resources.
